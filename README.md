# Windows 8 Installation
 
 
If you are installing Windows 10 on a PC running Windows XP or Windows Vista, or if you need to create installation media to install Windows 10 on a different PC, see Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC section below.
 
**Note**: Before you install Windows 10, check to make sure your PC meets the system requirements for Windows 10. We also recommend going to the PC manufacturer's website for any additional info about updated drivers and hardware compatibility.
 
**Download File ►►►►► [https://urluso.com/2A0Te2](https://urluso.com/2A0Te2)**


 
After downloading and installing, the tool will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC. All Windows 10 editions are available when you select Windows 10,except for Enterprise edition. For more information on Enterprise edition,go to the Volume Licensing Service Center.
 
If you have Office 2010 or earlier and choose to perform a clean install of Windows 10, you will need to locate your Office product key. For tips on locating your product key, check Find your Office 2010 product key or Enter the product key for your Office 2007 program.
 
If your PC does not automatically boot to the USB or DVD media, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your PC's BIOS or UEFI settings. To open a boot menu or change the boot order, you'll typically need to press a key (such as F2, F12, Delete, or Esc) immediately after you turn on your PC. For instructions on accessing the boot menu or changing the boot order for your PC, check the documentation that came with your PC or go to the manufacturer's website. If you do not see the USB or DVD media device listed within the boot options, you may need to reach out to the PC manufacturer for instructions for temporarily disabling Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.
 
If changing the boot menu or order doesn't work, and your PC immediately boots into the OS you want to replace, it is possible the PC had not fully shut down. To ensure the PC fully shuts down, select the power button on the sign-in screen or on the Start menu and select Shut down.
 
If you downloaded an ISO file for Windows 10, the file is saved locally at the location you selected. If you have a third-party DVD burning program installed on your computer that you prefer to use for creating the installation DVD, that program might open by going to the location where the file is saved and double-clicking the ISO file, or right-click the ISO file, select **Open with** and choose your preferred DVD burning software.
 
If you want to use the Windows Disk Image Burner to create an installation DVD, go to the location where the ISO file is saved. Right-click the ISO file and select **Properties**. On the General tab, click **Change** and select Windows Explorer for the program you would like to use to open ISO files and select **Apply**. Then right-click the ISO file and select **Burn disc image**.
 
If you want to install Windows 10 directly from the ISO file without using a DVD or flash drive, you can do so by mounting the ISO file. This will perform an upgrade of your current operating system to Windows 10.

Docker Desktop's functionality remains consistent on both WSL and Hyper-V, without a preference for either architecture. Hyper-V and WSL have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific set up and your planned use case.
 
Containers and images created with Docker Desktop are shared between alluser accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windowsaccounts use the same VM to build and run containers. Note that it is not possible to share containers and images between user accounts when using the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.
 
Running Docker Desktop inside a VMware ESXi or Azure VM is supported for Docker Business customers.It requires enabling nested virtualization on the hypervisor first.For more information, seeRunning Docker Desktop in a VM or VDI environment.
 
From the Docker Desktop menu, you can toggle which daemon (Linux or Windows)the Docker CLI talks to. Select **Switch to Windows containers** to use Windowscontainers, or select **Switch to Linux containers** to use Linux containers(the default).
 
Getting Started with Windows Containers (Lab)shows you how to use theMusicStoreapplication with Windows containers. The MusicStore is a standard .NET application and,forked here to use containers, is a good example of a multi-container application.
 
If you set proxies or daemon configuration in Windows containers mode, theseapply only on Windows containers. If you switch back to Linux containers,proxies and daemon configurations return to what you had set for Linuxcontainers. Your Windows container settings are retained and become availableagain when you switch back.
 
--admin-settings: Automatically creates an admin-settings.json file which is used by admins to control certain Docker Desktop settings on client machines within their organization. For more information, see Settings Management.
 
--proxy-enable-kerberosntlm: Enables Kerberos and NTLM proxy authentication. If you are enabling this, ensure your proxy server is properly configured for Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Available with Docker Desktop 4.32 and later.
 
--always-run-service: After installation completes, starts com.docker.service and sets the service startup type to Automatic. This circumvents the need for administrator privileges, which are otherwise necessary to start com.docker.service. com.docker.service is required by Windows containers and Hyper-V backend.
 
As an IT administrator, you can use endpoint management (MDM) software to identify the number of Docker Desktop instances and their versions within your environment. This can provide accurate license reporting, help ensure your machines use the latest version of Docker Desktop, and enable you toenforce sign-in.
 
This topic covers how to manually create a Windows installation flash drive from Windows installation ISO disc image file or DVD, and is intended for manufacturers looking into creating media that they can use to manufacture Windows devices.
 
The steps described on this page assume you have Windows installation media and access to a Windows technician PC. If you're looking for an easy, automated way to create a bootable Windows installation flash drive, see:
 
**Note:** MySQL 8.0 is the final series with MySQL Installer. As of MySQL 8.1, use a MySQL product's MSI or Zip archive for installation. MySQL Server 8.1 and higher also bundle MySQL Configurator, a tool that helps configure MySQL Server.

To fix this do a custom install without GeForce Experience and drivers, I have 3 Windows 10 machines with various OS releases on them (general and developer releases) and it works on each one of them.
 
I had newer or equivalent versions of these at the time of installation, so I did not include them in the installation. I felt that I should include this information just in case it does actually matter and help someone.
 
I have disabled-
GeForce Experience Software (had already installed newer version)
GeForce Drivers (had already installed newer version)
PhysX (had already installed newer version)
Visual Studio Integration.
 
I had a problem installing CUDA 11 with similar symptoms. (Also, nvidia-smi showed Cuda v10, and deviceQuery failed.) I needed to update Windows 10, update VisualStudio to 2019 then repeatedly uninstall **all** Nvidia programs. An older DLL NVCUDA64.dll (from an earlier CUDA v10 install) was particularly stubborn, but finally was able to remove it, reboot, then installing CUDA v11 worked ok.
 
Weirdly, I also have a Dell running windows 10, chose not to share information, and my install stopped at 18%. Going to try your advice of agreeing to share and see what happens. That is pretty shady if that is something automatic.
 
Oh Hell what a mess. So here is my plan. The drive appears to be fully functional, it is just this software install which does not work?? If that is the true, Go here: -en.wd.com/app/products/product-detail/p/119#WD\_downloads and download the Utilities, Security and Acronis (Backup) software. Install these and call it a day. If this fails I will be back to let you know.
 
Windows 11-After watching 18% for 10 min, I opened the task manager and ended the application in Processes and Apps completely. I went back to download it and was successful. It took less than a minute. If it stalls at 18%, delete and download again. Worked for me.
 
Ok SOLVED! You literally need to think outside the box. I experienced everything as you all were. It took me maybe an hour to figure this out. Drag the WD software off the storage to downloads or where ever you like to put your software and extract it from there. It completely installed and worked perfectly, synced all my drives and the WD is completely loaded and I can see the 100% space on it. I hope this helps you all. Also I am using Windows 11.

This is my first post here so I hope that this is of use to somebody I am a Systems Administrator used to working with Windows so this has been an interesting journey learning Linux / Ruby / Discourse etc.
 
Now copy and paste the following one-line installation script to set up the development environment. Depending on the speed of your computer and/or internet connection this might take a bit of time to complete, so go and grab a coffee or something!
 
Complete install packages are available from Moodle.org's Windows download page and also from Bitnami stacks. The packages are designed for new installations on a standalone computer. All of them use the popular XAMPP Apache Friends packages. The complete install package can be used on a server, but **it is not recommended that it be used as a production site**. Please note Moodle.org's Standard install packages only contain the Moodle code.
